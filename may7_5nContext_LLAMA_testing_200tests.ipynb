The phrase \"It's not what it looks like\" is a common idiomatic expression, but in this scene, it's being used in a way that's reminiscent of a soap opera or a melodrama, which adds a layer of humor to the situation. The fact that Sheldon is asking \"What does it look like?\" also implies that he's being obtuse and unaware of the obvious, which is a characteristic that's often played for comedic effect in the show.\n"
